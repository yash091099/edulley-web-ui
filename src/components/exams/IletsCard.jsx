        A typical letter of recommendation (LOR) follows a structured format, starting with the sender's contact information, date, and recipient's details, followed by a formal salutation on the official letterhead of the organization. The introduction should state the sender's relationship with the applicant and the context in which they know them. The body of the letter should provide specific examples and anecdotes that illustrate the applicant's qualities, skills, and achievements relevant to the program or position they are applying for. The conclusion should summarize the recommendation and express confidence in the applicant's abilities. The letter should close with a polite closing and the sender's signature, if possible. It's important to tailor the content and tone of the letter to the specific requirements of the recipient and to ensure that it is well-organized, clear, and concise.
