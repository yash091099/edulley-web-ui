        <h4 style={{fontFamily:"Gilroy-Bold"}}>Type of Letter of Recommendation</h4>
        <p style={{fontFamily:"Gilroy-Medium"}}>
        There are generally three types of letters of recommendation (LORs):

1. <strong>Academic LOR</strong>: These are written by teachers, professors, or academic advisors who can speak to your academic abilities, performance, and potential. Academic LORs are often required for graduate school applications and may focus on your academic achievements, coursework, research skills, and intellectual curiosity.

2. <strong>Professional LOR</strong>: These are written by employers, supervisors, or colleagues who can attest to your work ethic, skills, and professional accomplishments. Professional LORs are commonly required for job applications and may emphasize your work experience, accomplishments, leadership abilities, and teamwork skills.

3. <strong>Personal LO</strong>R: These are written by individuals who know you on a personal level, such as mentors, coaches, or community leaders. Personal LORs can provide insight into your character, values, and personal qualities. They are less common than academic or professional LORs but can be valuable in certain situations, such as for scholarships or special programs.

It's important to carefully read the application requirements to determine what type of LORs are needed and to choose recommenders who can provide relevant and impactful letters based on their relationship with you
